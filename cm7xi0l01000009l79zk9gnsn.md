### **What is Masscan?**

**Masscan** is an **ultra-fast port scanner** capable of scanning large networks in a short time. It provides **similar functionality to Nmap** but is optimized for high-speed scanning, allowing it to **scan millions of IPs and ports within minutes**.

---

### **Key Features of Masscan**

1. **Extremely Fast Scanning**
    
    * Can send **over 10 million packets per second** on a single machine.
        
    * Can scan **the entire IPv4 internet in about 6 minutes**.
        
2. **Asynchronous Scanning**
    
    * Uses its own **custom packet generation engine** for optimized performance.
        
    * Much faster than traditional scanners like Nmap.
        
3. **Nmap Compatibility**
    
    * Can output results in a format similar to Nmap.
        
    * However, it **does not** support all of Nmap's advanced features (e.g., service detection using a full **TCP 3-way handshake**).
        
4. **Flexible Target and Port Specification**
    
    * Allows scanning of specific networks or **the entire internet**.
        
    * Can target specific ports (e.g., HTTP **port 80**, HTTPS **port 443**, etc.).

### **Basic Usage of Masscan**

```bash
masscan -p80 192.168.1.0/24 --rate=10000
```

* `-p80` : Scan **port 80** (HTTP).
    
* `192.168.1.0/24` : Target **subnet**.
    
* `--rate=10000` : Send **10,000 packets per second**.
    

#### Example: Scanning the entire internet (IPv4)

```bash
masscan 0.0.0.0/0 -p443 --rate=100000
```

* `0.0.0.0/0` : Scan **the entire IPv4 address space**.
    
* `-p443` : Scan for **HTTPS servers**.
    
* `--rate=100000` : Set the **scan rate to 100,000 packets per second**.

### **Important Masscan Options**

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-p` | Specify ports to scan (e.g., `-p80,443,22`). |
| `-p0-65535` | Scan all **65,536 ports** on the target. |
| `--rate` | Set packet transmission speed (higher values increase speed but may cause packet loss). |
| `-iL <file>` | Read target IPs from a file. |
| `-oL <file>` | Save scan results to a file. |
| `-e <interface>` | Specify network interface to use (useful for multi-NIC systems). |
| `--banners` | Capture service banners when scanning. |
| `--exclude <IP>` | Exclude specific IPs or ranges from scanning. |
| `--exclude-file <file>` | Exclude IPs listed in a file. |

### **Limitations of Masscan**

* **Does not complete TCP connections** → Cannot detect services without additional scanning (e.g., **Nmap service detection** is required).
    
* **Consumes high network bandwidth** → May trigger firewall or **IDS/IPS** alerts.
    
* **Legal Concerns** → Unauthorized scanning **can be illegal**, so always obtain permission before use.

### **Masscan vs. Nmap**

| Feature | Masscan | Nmap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scanning Speed** | **Extremely fast** (asynchronous) | Slower (uses TCP 3-way handshake) |
| **Service Detection** | **Not supported** | **Supported** |
| **Firewall Evasion** | **Difficult** | **Possible** (with various techniques) |
| **Packet Generation** | Uses its **own engine** | Uses the **OS network stack** |
