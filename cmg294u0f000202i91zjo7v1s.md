# A Macroscopic View of Networks

From a broader perspective, a network is a **system for exchanging information (messages)**. To truly understand networking, it’s essential to know its fundamental components and the different ways it can be classified.

---

## 🧩 The Basic Structure of a Network

A network can be broken down into four main elements:

### 1\. Host

* End devices connected to the network (PCs, smartphones, servers, IoT devices, etc.)
    
* Entities that generate or consume data
    

### 2\. Network Devices

* Intermediate devices that manage and relay data flow
    
* Examples: Switches, routers, firewalls
    

### 3\. Transmission Media

* The physical path through which data is delivered
    
* Wired: UTP cables, fiber optic cables
    
* Wireless: Wi-Fi, 5G, satellite
    

### 4\. Message

* The actual unit of information transmitted across the network
    
* Examples: emails, files, streaming videos, sensor data
    

👉 In essence, the interaction of **hosts ↔ devices ↔ media ↔ messages** is what defines a network.

---

## 🌍 Classification by Scope

Networks can also be categorized by their size and geographical coverage.

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**
    
    * Small-scale networks (homes, offices, schools)
        
    * High speed, easy to manage
        
    * Example: Wi-Fi router in your house
        
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
    
    * Large-scale networks (cities, nations, worldwide)
        
    * Connects multiple LANs → foundation of the Internet
        
    * Example: ISP backbone, global Internet
        

---

## 📦 Classification by Switching Method

How a message is transmitted determines the switching method.

* **Circuit Switching**
    
    * Like a telephone line: a dedicated path is established before communication begins
        
    * **Pros:** stable connection, minimal delay during use
        
    * **Cons:** resource waste (the line stays occupied even during idle time)
        
    * Example: traditional landline phone networks
        
* **Packet Switching**
    
    * Messages are split into packets, sent across various paths, then reassembled at the destination
        
    * **Pros:** efficient resource usage, supports diverse traffic types
        
    * **Cons:** possible delays, packet loss requires retransmission
        
    * Example: the Internet
        

👉 Today’s Internet is built primarily on packet switching.

---

## ✨ Summary

* **Four core elements:** host, devices, media, messages
    
* **By scope:** LAN vs WAN
    
* **By switching method:** circuit vs packet
    

When viewed from a high level, networking is simply about **safely and efficiently transferring information**—the underlying mechanisms just differ. Understanding this framework makes advanced concepts (TCP/IP, routing, protocols, etc.) much easier to connect.

## \[Digging Deeper\] Transmission Methods by Destination

When a message is sent, **“who receives it”** defines the communication type. There are four major categories:

### 1️⃣ Unicast

* **Definition:** One sender → one receiver (1:1)
    
* **Features:** Most common method
    
* **Examples:** Web browsing (client ↔ server), sending/receiving emails
    

### 2️⃣ Broadcast

* **Definition:** One sender → all hosts on the same network (1:all)
    
* **Features:** Limited to the same LAN segment
    
* **Examples:**
    
    * ARP requests (IP → MAC address resolution)
        
    * DHCP Discover (requesting an IP)
        
* ⚠️ Routers block broadcast traffic—it doesn’t cross network boundaries.
    

### 3️⃣ Multicast

* **Definition:** One sender → multiple specific receivers (1:group)
    
* **Features:** Only group members receive the data, making it efficient
    
* **Examples:**
    
    * Live streaming
        
    * Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams, IPTV)
        
* **IP Range:** 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Class D addresses)
    

### 4️⃣ Anycast

* **Definition:** One sender → the “closest” receiver (network-wise) among many possible ones
    
* **Features:** Optimizes delivery by selecting the nearest node
    
* **Examples:**
    
    * DNS servers (Google DNS: 8.8.8.8)
        
    * CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

## ✨ At a Glance: Comparison

| Transmission Type | Structure | Example Services | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unicast** | 1:1 | Web browsing, email | Standard communication method |
| **Broadcast** | 1:all | ARP, DHCP Discover | Works only within the same LAN |
| **Multicast** | 1:group | IPTV, video conferencing | Efficient group communication |
| **Anycast** | 1:nearest 1 | DNS, CDN | Optimized by proximity |

# Looking at Networks Microscopically

Previously, we explored networks from a **macroscopic perspective**.  
Now, let’s zoom in and examine them **microscopically**—understanding the internal mechanisms of how data is transmitted, what rules govern communication, and how everything fits together.

---

## 🔑 Protocols

To exchange data over a network, we need **rules**.  
These rules are called **protocols**.

* Just like humans need a **language** to converse, computers need protocols.
    
* Examples:
    
    * HTTP → transfers web pages
        
    * SMTP → sends emails
        
    * TCP/UDP → defines transmission methods
        

👉 In short, protocols are the **“grammar of network conversations.”**

---

## 📐 Network Reference Models

Because network operations are complex, **reference models** were created to describe them layer by layer.

### 1\. OSI 7-Layer Model

A **theoretical model** defined by ISO.

* Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Session → Presentation → Application
    

→ Useful for study and teaching, but **never fully implemented in reality**.

### 2\. TCP/IP 4-Layer Model

The **practical model** used in the real Internet.

* Network Access → Internet → Transport → Application
    

→ Today’s Internet essentially runs on the **TCP/IP model**.

---

## 📦 Encapsulation and Decapsulation

When sending data, the network follows a process of **wrapping and unwrapping**.

### 1\. Encapsulation

* The sender’s data passes through each layer, with a **header** added at each step.
    
* Similar to preparing a package with an **address, sender info, and shipping details**.
    

### 2\. Decapsulation

* The receiver strips away each header at every layer, **interpreting the data**.
    
* Like **unwrapping a package** to check the contents inside.
    

---

## 🔹 PDU (Protocol Data Unit)

Each layer has its own term for the data unit it handles:

* Application Layer → Data
    
* Transport Layer → Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)
    
* Network Layer → Packet
    
* Data Link Layer → Frame
    
* Physical Layer → Bit
    

👉 PDUs are simply the **“data units defined at each layer.”**

---

## \[Learn More\] OSI 7-Layers and TCP/IP 4-Layers Don’t Actually “Run”

Many assume that computers literally follow the **OSI 7-layer stack**.  
But in fact, the OSI model is just a **conceptual explanation tool**—not a real implementation.

In practice, what matters are the **TCP/IP model and actual protocols**.  
The OSI model is academically valuable, while TCP/IP runs the Internet.

---

## \[Learn More\] Traffic and Network Performance Metrics

Understanding a network also means knowing its **performance indicators**.

* **Throughput** → actual amount of data transferred
    
* **Bandwidth** → maximum theoretical transmission speed
    
* **Packet Loss** → percentage of data lost during transfer
