## **Goal**

The attacker gathers intelligence about the target to plan future attacks.

## Acquire Access

### **Acquisition of Access to Systems and Networks**

* Purchasing access to already compromised systems (e.g., backdoors, remote services)
    
* Buying or developing infrastructure, accounts, and malware
    

### **Mitigations**

**Pre-compromise:** Actions are performed outside the scope of cybersecurity defense measures and therefore cannot be mitigated.

### **Detection**

**Detection:** Activities occur outside the scope of cybersecurity defenses, making them difficult to detect using defensive techniques.

## Establish Accounts

* Creating social media, email, and cloud accounts for phishing attacks
    
* Setting up accounts on platforms such as **Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Google, GitHub, Docker Hub**, etc., and configuring profiles, photos, and other details to appear legitimate
    

## Compromise Accounts

* Using **Establish Accounts** to steal key account information of the target through phishing, purchases, brute-force attacks, or insider threats
    
* **Compromising email accounts** enhances phishing credibility
    
* **Compromising social media accounts** makes the **Establish Accounts** process appear more legitimate
    
* **Compromising email accounts** improves the effectiveness of phishing attacks
    

## Acquire Infrastructure

* Securing various types of infrastructure for future cyber attacks
    
* Acquiring **domains, DNS servers, virtual private servers (VPS), insiders, botnets, web services, serverless cloud environments, and malicious advertisements (Malvertising, 2023.02)**
    

## Compromise Infrastructure

* Hijacking various types of infrastructure for future cyber attacks
    
* Depending on the compromised infrastructure, attackers can **conceal their activities** and **enhance the credibility of the infected infrastructure**
    

## Develop Capabilities

* Developing **exploitation tools, malware, and certificates** for use in cyber attacks
    

## Obtain Capabilities

* Acquiring, purchasing, or stealing **exploitation tools, malware, and certificates** for use in cyber attacks.
    

## Stage Capabilities

* **Uploading, installing, and configuring attack tools** on the attacker's infrastructure
    
* Infrastructure may include both **acquired and compromised** infrastructure
