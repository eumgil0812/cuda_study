## 📘 I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

### 1) Concept

I2C is a **two-wire serial communication bus** used to connect multiple devices. It is commonly used for **sensors, EEPROMs, PMICs, RTCs, touch controllers**, and other **low-speed peripherals**.

```c
SPI: faster, requires more wires (typically 4+)
I2C: slower, but only needs 2 wires
```

Therefore, I2C is preferred when **wiring simplicity** is more important than data rate.

---

### 2) Bus Signals (Only 2 Lines)

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **SCL (Clock)** | Clock generated by the master |
| **SDA (Data)** | Bidirectional data line |

Both lines use **open-drain** signaling, so **pull-up resistors** (typically 2.2kΩ–10kΩ) are required.

```c
SCL ────┬─■(Pull-up)─ Vcc
SDA ────┤
```

---

### 3) Roles: Master & Slave

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Master** | Generates SCL, initiates and terminates communication (usually the MCU) |
| **Slave** | Responds to master requests (sensors, memory devices, etc.) |

A single I2C bus can have **multiple slave devices**, each addressed individually.

---

### 4) Data Transfer Rules

I2C communication follows this sequence:

```c
START
→ Slave Address (7-bit or 10-bit)
→ R/W bit (0 = Write, 1 = Read)
→ ACK
→ Data (1 byte at a time)
→ ACK after each byte
→ STOP
```

#### Important: I2C transfers **1 byte (8 bits)** at a time,

and the **receiver responds with 1 additional bit**:

| Frame Element | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **8 data bits** | Sent by master or slave |
| **1 ACK/NACK bit** | Sent by the receiver on the 9th clock |

| Response | Bit Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ACK** | SDA pulled **LOW (0)** | “Byte received, continue.” |
| **NACK** | SDA remains **HIGH (1)** | “Cannot receive more, stop here.” |

Example: Writing value `0xAB` to slave `0x50`:

```c
START
0x50 + Write(0) → ACK
0xAB           → ACK
STOP
```

---

### 5) Speed Modes

| Mode | Data Rate | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | 100 kbps | Basic communication |
| Fast | 400 kbps | Common default |
| Fast Plus | 1 Mbps | Higher-speed sensors |
| High-Speed | 3.4 Mbps | Specialized applications |

Compared to SPI/QSPI, **I2C is significantly slower**.

---

### 6) Advantages

* **Very simple wiring** (only two lines)
    
* Easy to add multiple slave devices (address-based)
    
* Low hardware cost (just pull-up resistors)
    

---

### 7) Disadvantages

* **Slow data rate**
    
* Signal integrity can degrade with cable length or noise
    
* Open-drain signaling → **less clean waveforms**
    
* If ACK/NACK handling fails, the **bus may lock up (hang)**
    

Thus, **I2C Bus Recovery routines are commonly required in real firmware**.

### 8) Comparison with SPI/QSPI

| Feature | I2C | SPI | QSPI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number of wires | 2 | 4+ | 6 |
| Speed | Slow | Fast | Faster |
| Topology | Multi-slave bus | Point-to-point | Point-to-point |
| Typical usage | Sensors, EEPROM | ADC/DAC, high-speed peripherals | External flash / firmware storage |
| Hardware complexity | Low | Medium | High |

---

### 9) One-Line Summary

```c
I2C is a low-speed serial bus that uses only two wires and transfers data one byte at a time,
with the receiver sending an ACK/NACK bit after each byte.
```
