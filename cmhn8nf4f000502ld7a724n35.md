## 📘 CSI-2 (Camera Serial Interface 2)

### 1) Concept

CSI-2 is a **high-speed serial interface** used to transfer image data from a **camera sensor** to a **processor (MCU/SoC/ISP)**. The “2” indicates that it is the **second-generation camera interface standard defined by the MIPI Alliance**.

```c
Image Sensor → (CSI-2) → SoC / ISP
```

CSI-2 is widely used in **smartphones, drones, automotive cameras, and industrial vision systems**.

---

### 2) Why CSI-2? (Compared to SPI / Parallel Interfaces)

| Interface | Characteristics | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Parallel (DVP, etc.)** | Transfers multiple bits at once | Requires many pins, complex PCB routing |
| **SPI / QSPI** | Uses fewer pins | Bandwidth too low for high-resolution video |
| ✅ **CSI-2** | **High bandwidth with few pins** | Requires PHY + protocol understanding |

CSI-2 allows **high-resolution, high-FPS video transfer** while keeping **pin count low**.

---

### 3) Signal Structure

CSI-2 is transported over **MIPI D-PHY** or **C-PHY**. The most common is **D-PHY**.

| Signal Lane | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Clock Lane (1 differential pair)** | Timing reference for data transfer |
| **Data Lanes (1–4 differential pairs)** | Carries image data |

Example physical wiring:

```c
CLK+   CLK-
DATA0+ DATA0-
DATA1+ DATA1-
...
```

These are **differential pairs**, which provide:

* High noise immunity
    
* Stable operation at **multi-Gbps speeds**
    

---

### 4) Two Operating Modes (LP vs HS)

CSI-2 alternates between two signaling modes:

| Mode | Speed | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LP (Low-Power) Mode** | Mbps-level | Sensor configuration & control |
| **HS (High-Speed) Mode** | Gbps-level | Actual frame data transmission |

Flow:

```c
Configure camera → LP mode
Start streaming → HS mode
End frame → back to LP mode
```

---

### 5) Data Format (Packet-Based Transmission)

CSI-2 does **not** transmit raw bit streams. It sends **packets**:

```c
[Header] [Payload (pixel data)] [CRC/ECC]
```

This allows:

* Data integrity checking
    
* Lane alignment and frame reconstruction
    

---

### 6) Common Pixel Formats

| Format | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RAW10 | 10-bit per pixel raw sensor output |
| RAW12 | 12-bit per pixel raw data |
| YUV422 | Semi-processed color output |
| RGB888 | Fully expanded color data |

Most sensors output **RAW10 / RAW12**, which the ISP converts later.

---

### 7) What the Processor Must Handle (Important in Practice)

On the SoC side, the CSI-2 receiver and image pipeline must be configured:

1. Number of data lanes
    
2. Virtual channel selection
    
3. Pixel format configuration
    
4. Enable CSI-2 receiver hardware
    
5. Route frames to **ISP or DMA → Framebuffer / Memory**
    

CSI-2 is **not just wiring** — it requires:

* CSI Receiver hardware block
    
* Driver configuration
    
* Image pipeline setup
    

---

### 8) Summary

```c
CSI-2 is a high-speed serial camera interface using differential lanes.
It switches between low-power mode for configuration and high-speed mode for streaming.
Image data is transmitted as packets (RAW/YUV/RGB), which the SoC receives and processes through its CSI receiver and ISP pipeline.
```
