In computer networks, the **Physical Layer** and the **Data Link Layer** sit at the bottom of the OSI 7-layer model. They define **how data is actually transmitted across the medium**. In this chapter, we will go through Ethernet, NICs and cables, hubs, and switches.

## 01\. Ethernet

### 1) Ethernet Standards

* The most widely used technology in **Local Area Networks (LANs)**
    
* Based on the IEEE 802.3 standard
    
* Evolution of transmission speeds:
    
    * **10 Mbps**: Original Ethernet
        
    * **100 Mbps**: Fast Ethernet
        
    * **1 Gbps**: Gigabit Ethernet
        
    * **10 Gbps and beyond**: Data centers, backbone networks
        

---

### 2) Transmission Media Notation

Example: **100BASE-TX**

* **100**: Transmission speed (100 Mbps)
    
* **BASE**: Baseband signaling (digital transmission)
    
* **TX**: Type of transmission medium
    
    * **T**: Twisted Pair
        
    * **F**: Fiber optic
        

ðŸ’¡ Examples:

* **10BASE-T** â†’ 10 Mbps using UTP cable
    
* **1000BASE-SX** â†’ 1 Gbps using short-range multimode fiber

### 3) Ethernet Frame Structure

```cpp
| Preamble | Destination MAC | Source MAC | Type/Length | Data | FCS |
```

* **Preamble**: Synchronization signal (alternating 1s and 0s)
    
* **Destination MAC / Source MAC**: Hardware addresses of sender and receiver
    
* **Type/Length**: Identifies the upper-layer protocol (e.g., IP, ARP)
    
* **Data**: Payload (minimum 46 bytes, maximum 1500 bytes)
    
* **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**: Error detection using CRC
    

---

### 4) \[More to Know\] Token Ring

* Developed by IBM
    
* Only the device holding a **token** can transmit data
    
* Advantage: No collisions
    
* Disadvantage: If one device fails, the entire network is affected â†’ rarely used today

## 02\. NIC and Cables

### 1) NIC (Network Interface Card)

* **Appearance**: Installed as a card on the motherboard, or built-in as a chipset
    
* **Roles**:
    
    * Connects a computer to the network
        
    * Provides a unique **MAC address**
        
    * Converts digital data into electrical/optical signals and vice versa
        

ðŸ’¡ Examples: Wi-Fi NIC, Ethernet NIC

---

### 2) Twisted Pair Cable

* **Appearance**: Copper wires twisted together to reduce interference
    
* **Types**:
    
    * **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**: No shielding, low cost
        
    * **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**: Shielded against electromagnetic noise, more expensive
        
* **Categories**:
    
    * **Cat5e**: 100 Mbps ~ 1 Gbps
        
    * **Cat6**: 1 ~ 10 Gbps
        
    * **Cat7/8**: High-performance, used in data centers
        

---

### 3) Fiber Optic Cable

* **Appearance**: Glass or plastic fibers transmitting data using light
    
* **Single Mode Fiber (SMF)**:
    
    * Straight path, uses laser light
        
    * Supports several kilometers to tens of kilometers
        
    * Ideal for long-distance communication
        
* **Multimode Fiber (MMF)**:
    
    * Multiple paths for light
        
    * Limited to hundreds of meters
        
    * Suitable for LANs and building-level connections

NIC / MAC address / Twisted pair / Fiber optic / Cable categories

| Type | Characteristics | Distance | Example Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UTP | Low-cost, no shield | Tens to hundreds of meters | Home/office LAN |
| STP | Noise-resistant | Tens to hundreds of meters | Industrial sites |
| Fiber (SMF) | Long distance, high speed | Several km ~ tens of km | Backbone, ISP |
| Fiber (MMF) | Shorter range, cheaper | Hundreds of meters | Building LAN |

## 03\. Hub

### 1) Features of a Hub

* Operates at the **Physical Layer**
    
* Forwards incoming signals to all ports (broadcast)
    
* Simple but inefficient (many collisions)
    

---

### 2) Collision Domain

* A network segment where packet collisions can occur
    
* With hubs, all ports share **one collision domain** â†’ high collision rates
    

---

### 3) CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

A method to reduce collisions in Ethernet:

1. **Carrier Sense**: Check if the channel is idle before sending
    
2. **Multiple Access**: Many devices can attempt to use the channel
    
3. **Collision Detection**: Detect if a collision occurs (signal corruption)
    
4. **Backoff and Retry**: Wait a random time and retransmit

## 04\. Switch

### 1) Features of a Switch

* Operates at the **Data Link Layer**
    
* Forwards frames based on **MAC addresses**
    
* Supports independent communication between ports â†’ fewer collisions
    

---

### 2) MAC Address Learning

* The switch records the **source MAC address** of incoming frames into its MAC address table
    
* When sending, it looks up the destination MAC and forwards only to the correct port
    

---

### 3) VLAN (Virtual LAN)

* Logically separates one physical network into multiple sub-networks
    
* **Port-based VLAN**: Divides based on port numbers
    
* **MAC-based VLAN**: Divides based on device MAC addresses
    
* Benefits: Improved security, traffic separation, simplified management
