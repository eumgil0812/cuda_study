## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Locks?

* Shared variable updates (e.g., `balance = balance + 1;`) form a **critical section**.
    
* Without locks, multiple threads executing simultaneously lead to **race conditions**.
    
* A lock ensures the critical section executes **as if it were atomic**, eliminating corruption.
    

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Lock?

* A lock is just a variable that stores state:
    
    * **free (unlocked)**: no thread holds it.
        
    * **locked**: exactly one thread owns it, executing the critical section.
        
* Abstracts away queues or ownership details, exposing a simple interface.
    

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works

```c
lock(&mutex);          // try to acquire
balance = balance + 1; // critical section
unlock(&mutex);        // release
```

* If free ‚Üí immediate acquisition.
    
* If locked ‚Üí caller waits until the lock is released.
    
* At unlock, another waiting thread is allowed in.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Problems & Solutions

### ‚ùå Too Much Spinning

* On a single CPU:
    
    * Thread 0 holds the lock but gets interrupted.
        
    * Thread 1 spins endlessly, wasting cycles.
        
* With N threads, (N-1) waste CPU ‚Üí terrible efficiency.
    
* Core issue: **busy-waiting wastes CPU**.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Yielding

* If lock is busy, call `yield()` to let scheduler run someone else.
    
* Works fine with **2 threads on 1 CPU**.
    
* Problems:
    
    * Many threads ‚Üí massive context-switch overhead.
        
    * Possible **starvation** (some threads never get the lock).
        

---

### ‚úÖ Sleeping Locks

* Instead of spinning, a thread **sleeps** (park) until awakened.
    
* Mechanism:
    
    * `lock()`: if free ‚Üí acquire; else enqueue + sleep.
        
    * `unlock()`: if queue empty ‚Üí free; else wake one.
        
* Advantage: avoids CPU waste.
    
* Challenge: **wakeup/wait race** ‚Üí must use safe primitives (e.g., Solaris `setpark()`).

### ‚ùå Priority Inversion

* High-priority thread waits on a lock held by low-priority thread.
    
* Scheduler keeps running the high-priority thread, but it just spins.
    
* Example: **NASA Mars Pathfinder** failure.
    
* Solutions:
    
    * Avoid spinlocks ‚Üí use blocking locks.
        
    * **Priority inheritance** (temporarily boost low thread‚Äôs priority).
        
    * Normalize thread priorities.

### ‚úÖ OS Support: Futex (Linux)

* **Fast Userspace Mutex**:
    
    * User space: CAS/atomic for fast uncontended path.
        
    * If contention: enter kernel, sleep with `futex_wait()`.
        
    * Unlock: wake with `futex_wake()`.
        
* Stores state (lock bit + waiters) in a single integer.
    
* Advantage: **fast path when uncontended**, kernel only on conflict.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Two-Phase Lock

* Old idea (1960s Dahm locks).
    
* **Phase 1**: short spin, hoping lock frees quickly.
    
* **Phase 2**: if still locked, go to sleep.
    
* Combines **low latency of spin** with **efficiency of sleep**.
    
* Linux futex locks effectively use this hybrid.
    
* Downside: effectiveness varies by workload and system.

## üëâ One-Line Takeaway

**Locks turn chaotic scheduling into order by making critical sections behave atomically. But naive locks waste CPU (spinning), can starve threads, or invert priorities ‚Äî so modern systems use hybrids like futex and two-phase locks.**
